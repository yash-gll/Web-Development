                <h2>Portfolio management</h2>
                <p>Portfolio management refers to the art and science of making decisions about investments that align with an individual or organization's objectives. In managing a portfolio, one seeks to balance risk and reward in such a way as to achieve the desired return on investment while controlling the degree of exposure to potential market volatility. This requires a deep understanding of both the investment landscape and the specific needs of the investor, which can vary widely depending on factors such as age, income, and life stage.</p>
